Last updated: 24/04/23

LifeReels ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting and maintaining your privacy. <br> This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and disclose your personal <br> information when you use LifeReels mobile application hereafter referred to as “the App”. <br> <br>

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this <br> policy. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, do not use the App. <br> <br>

Information Collection and Use <br>
We collect various types of information to provide and improve our App, as well as for <br> analytics and marketing purposes. <br> <br>

Personal Data <br>
While using our App, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable <br> information, such as your name and email address. We collect this information to create and <br> maintain your account, provide customer support, and communicate with you. <br> <br>

Usage Data <br>
We may also collect information about how the App is accessed and used. This usage data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP address), device type, operating system, unique device identifier, app usage, and other diagnostic data.

Third-Party Services
Our App uses Firebase, a service provided by Google, for authentication, data storage, and analytics. We also use Google Analytics to help us understand how our App is being used and to improve our services. Google Analytics collects usage data, which may include information about your device, operating system, and in-app behavior. This data is anonymized and aggregated to protect your privacy.

Google uses this information to evaluate your use of the App, compile reports on app activity, and provide other services related to app usage and internet usage. You can review Google's privacy policy at https://policies.google.com/privacy.

Camera and Microphone Access
To create videos within the App, we require access to your device's camera and microphone. The videos you create are stored on Firebase Storage, and related data is stored on Firestore. You have the option to delete your videos and related data within the App.

Push Notifications
We may send you push notifications to keep you updated with reminders, alerts, and other relevant information. You can manage your notification preferences or opt out of receiving notifications at any time through your device settings or within the App.

Data Retention
We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to provide you with the App's services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.

Data Security
We take the security of your personal information seriously and implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect it from unauthorized access, loss, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our website (https://edwardapps.github.io).
